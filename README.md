Image Generator

This is a minimal web app that generates images using OpenAI's API. Built it because I wanted something simple to bulk generate.

- Batch generation: click generate multiple times, all run concurrently
- Your own API key: stored locally in browser
- Direct API calls: browser talks directly to OpenAI
- Clean UI: minimal design, no fancy shit
- Download images: click to save any generated image

Will maybe add more models and providers
